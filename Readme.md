# Week 1
Learning using the above pluralsight Java Course.

Variables:
- int firstVariable = 25; // This can be changed 
- final secondVariable = 30 // 'final' value can't be changed once it is set

Data Types:
- Integer types (byte (-128...127), short (-32768...32767), int (-2147483648...2147483647), long (-(massiveNumber)L ... (massiveNumber)L))
- Floating Point Types (float (-(number.number)f...(number.number)f), double (-(biggerNumber.biggerNumber)d...(biggerNumber.biggerNumber)d)
- Character Type [single character not strings] (char)
- Boolean Type (has values of either true or false)

Arithmetic Operators:
